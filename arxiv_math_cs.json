This allows us to figure out thenecessary conditions for optimality. In this way, we train the neural networkvia solving the Pontryagin&#39;s Maximum Principle (PMP). The adversary is onlycoupled with the first layer weight in PMP. It inspires us to split theadversary computation from the back propagation gradient computation. As aresult, our proposed YOPO (You Only Propagate Once) avoids forward and backwardthe data too many times in one iteration, and restricts core descent directionscomputation to the first layer of the network, thus speeding up every iterationsignificantly. For adversarial example defense, our experiment shows that YOPOcan achieve comparable defense accuracy using around 1/5 GPU time of theoriginal projected gradient descent training.", "subject": "math"}, {"title": "Strong Converse for Classical-Quantum Degraded Broadcast Channels\"", "author": ["Cheng, Hao-Chung\"", "Datta, Nilanjana\"", "Rouz\u00e9, Cambyse\""], "date": "2019/05/02\"", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00874", "abstract": "We consider the transmission of classical information through a degradedbroadcast channel, whose outputs are two quantum systems, with the state of onebeing a degraded version of the other.

The standard sampling scheme for finite DPPs is a spectral decompositionfollowed by an equivalent of a randomly diagonally-pivoted Choleskyfactorization of an orthogonal projection, which is only applicable toHermitian kernels and has an expensive setup cost. Researchers have begun toconnect DPP sampling to $LDL^H$ factorizations as a means of avoiding theinitial spectral decomposition, but existing approaches have only outperformedthe spectral decomposition approach in special circumstances, where the numberof kept modes is a small percentage of the ground set size.

The NGNB can also be obtained from theCOM-Negative Hypergeometric distribution (Roy et al. 2019)[10] as a limitingdistribution. In this paper, we present closed-form approximations for the meanand variance of the NGNB distribution. These approximations can be viewed asthe mean and variance of convolution of independent and identically distributednegative binomial populations. The proposed closed-form approximations of themean and variance will be helpful in building the link function for thegeneralized negative binomial regression model based on the NGNB distributionand other extended applications, hence resulting in enhanced applicability ofthis model.", "subject": "math"}, {"title": "On Hyperbolic Polynomials and Four-term Recurrence with Linear Coefficients\"", "author": ["Adams, Richard\""], "date": "2019/04/29\"", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12455", "abstract": "For any real numbers $a,\\ b$, and $c$, we form the sequence of polynomials$\\{P_n(z)\\}_{n=0}^\\infty$ satisfying the four-term recurrence \\[P_n(z)+azP_{n-1}(z)+bP_{n-2}(z)+czP_{n-3}(z)=0,\\ n\\in\\mathbb{N}, \\] with theinitial conditions $P_0(z)=1$ and $P_{-n}(z)=0$.

Next, we explainthat homogeneous YB deformation can be regarded as a kind of the $O(d,d)$duality transformations. Once YB deformations are realized as dualitytransformations, the corresponding $O(d,d)$ transformations are applied toalmost all backgrounds. Moreover, we discuss spacetime structures ofhomogeneous YB deformed backgrounds and clarify a T-fold structure of them byshowing the associated $O(d,d; \\mathbb{Z})$ $T$-duality monodromy. Finally, weconsider the Weyl invariance of string theories in generalized supergravitybackgrounds. We show that generalized supergravity can be reproduced fromdouble field theory with the dilaton depending on a linear dual coordinate.From this result, we construct a possible counterterm to cancel out the Weylanomaly of bosonic string theories on generalized supergravity backgrounds.

Our approach makes use of adistributionally robust optimization (DRO) formulation that translates the datasize requirement into a Monte Carlo sample size requirement drawn from what wecall a generating distribution. We show that, while the optimal choice of thisgenerating distribution is the one eliciting the data or the baselinedistribution in a nonparametric divergence-based DRO, it is not necessarily soin the parametric case.

However recentworks have shown that deep networks can be vulnerable to adversarialperturbations which slightly changes the input but leads to incorrectprediction. Adversarial training is an effective way of improving therobustness to the adversarial examples, typically formulated as a robustoptimization problem for network training. To solve it, previous works directlyrun gradient descent on the &#34;adversarial loss&#34;, i.e. replacing the input datawith the corresponding adversaries. A major drawback of this approach is thecomputational overhead of adversary generation, which is much larger thannetwork updating and leads to inconvenience in adversarial defense.  To address this issue, we fully exploit structure of deep neural networks andpropose a novel strategy to decouple the adversary update with the gradientback propagation. To achieve this goal, we follow the research line consideringtraining deep neural network as an optimal control problem. We formulate therobust optimization as a differential game. This allows us to figure out thenecessary conditions for optimality. In this way, we train the neural networkvia solving the Pontryagin&#39;s Maximum Principle (PMP). The adversary is onlycoupled with the first layer weight in PMP. It inspires us to split theadversary computation from the back propagation gradient computation. As aresult, our proposed YOPO (You Only Propagate Once) avoids forward and backwardthe data too many times in one iteration, and restricts core descent directionscomputation to the first layer of the network, thus speeding up every iterationsignificantly. For adversarial example defense, our experiment shows that YOPOcan achieve comparable defense accuracy using around 1/5 GPU time of theoriginal projected gradient descent training.", "subject": "cs"}, {"title": "Strong Converse for Classical-Quantum Degraded Broadcast Channels\"", "author": ["Cheng, Hao-Chung\"", "Datta, Nilanjana\"", "Rouz\u00e9, Cambyse\""], "date": "2019/05/02\"", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00874", "abstract": "We consider the transmission of classical information through a degradedbroadcast channel, whose outputs are two quantum systems, with the state of onebeing a degraded version of the other.

Methods: An endoscopic system based on a multi-fiberprobe was previously developed to sparsely capture HSI data (sHSI). These werecombined with RGB images, via a deep neural network, to generatehigh-resolution hypercubes and calculate StO2.

More precisely, thebasic idea in tabulation hashing is to view a key as consisting of $c=O(1)$characters, e.g., a 64-bit key as $c=8$ characters of 8-bits. The characterdomain $\u03a3$ should be small enough that character tables of size $|\u03a3|$fit in fast cache. The schemes then use $O(1)$ tables of this size, so thespace of tabulation hashing is $O(|\u03a3|)$. However the above concentrationbounds only apply if the expected sums are $\\ll |\u03a3|$.  To see the problem, consider the very simple case where we use tabulationhashing to throw $n$ balls into $m$ bins and apply Chernoff bounds to thenumber of balls that land in a given bin. We are fine if $n=m$, for then theexpected value is $1$. However, if $m=2$ bins as when tossing $n$ unbiasedcoins, then the expectancy $n/2$ is $\\gg |\u03a3|$ for large data sets, e.g.,data sets that don&#39;t fit in fast cache.

An increasingly number of publications followthe concept of embedding the CT reconstruction as a known operator into aneural network. However, most of the approaches presented lack an efficient CTreconstruction framework fully integrated into deep learning environments. As aresult, many approaches are forced to use workarounds for mathematicallyunambiguously solvable problems. Methods: PYRO-NN is a generalized framework toembed known operators into the prevalent deep learning framework Tensorflow.The current status includes state-of-the-art parallel-, fan- and cone-beamprojectors and back-projectors accelerated with CUDA provided as Tensorflowlayers. On top, the framework provides a high level Python API to conduct FBPand iterative reconstruction experiments with data from real CT systems.Results: The framework provides all necessary algorithms and tools to designend-to-end neural network pipelines with integrated CT reconstructionalgorithms. The high level Python API allows a simple use of the layers asknown from Tensorflow. To demonstrate the capabilities of the layers, theframework comes with three baseline experiments showing a cone-beam short scanFDK reconstruction, a CT reconstruction filter learning setup, and a TVregularized iterative reconstruction. All algorithms and tools are referencedto a scientific publication and are compared to existing non deep learningreconstruction frameworks. The framework is available as open-source softwareat \\url{https://github.com/csyben/PYRO-NN}.

Automatic emotion recognition (AER) usingelectroencephalogram (EEG) signals is an effective method for decoding the realemotions, which are independent of body gestures, but it is a challengingproblem. Several automatic emotion recognition systems have been proposed,which are based on traditional hand-engineered approaches and theirperformances are very poor. Motivated by the outstanding performance of deeplearning (DL) in many recognition tasks, we introduce an AER system (Deep-AER)based on EEG brain signals using DL. A DL model involves a large number oflearnable parameters, and its training needs a large dataset of EEG signals,which is difficult to acquire for AER problem. To overcome this problem, weproposed a lightweight pyramidal one-dimensional convolutional neural network(LP-1D-CNN) model, which involves a small number of learnable parameters. UsingLP-1D-CNN, we build a two level ensemble model. In the first level of theensemble, each channel is scanned incrementally by LP-1D-CNN to generatepredictions, which are fused using majority vote. The second level of theensemble combines the predictions of all channels of an EEG signal usingmajority vote for detecting the emotion state. We validated the effectivenessand robustness of Deep-AER using DEAP, a benchmark dataset for emotionrecognition research. The results indicate that FRONT plays dominant role inAER and over this region, Deep-AER achieved the accuracies of 98.43% and 97.65%for two AER problems, i.e., high valence vs low valence (HV vs LV) and higharousal vs low arousal (HA vs LA), respectively.

Torealize the data extraction directly from the encrypted domain without theprivate key, a key-switching based least-significant-bit (KS-LSB) data hidingmethod has been designed. In application, the user first encrypts the plaintextand uploads ciphertext to the server. Then the server performs data hiding byFHEE-DE and KS-LSB to obtain the marked ciphertext. Additional data can beextracted directly from the marked ciphertext by the server without the privatekey. The user can decrypt the marked ciphertext to obtain the marked plaintext.Then additional data or plaintext can be obtained from the marked plaintext byusing the standard DE extraction or recovery. A fidelity constraint of DE isintroduced to reduce the distortion of the marked plaintext.

In this work, we devise and analyze a mathematical model describing suchplatforms. The model includes a large number of agents attempting to learn anunderlying true state of the world in an iterative fashion. At each iteration,these agents update their beliefs about the true state based on noisyobservations of the true state and the beliefs of a subset of other agents.These subsets may include a special type of agent we call bots, who attempt toconvince others of an erroneous true state rather than learn (modeling usersspreading fake news). This process continues for a finite number of iterationswe call the learning horizon.  Our analysis details three cases for the outcome of this process: agents maylearn the true state, mistake the erroneous state promoted by the bots as true,or believe the state falls between the true and erroneous states. Which outcomeoccurs depends on the relationship between the number of bots and the learninghorizon. This leads to several interesting consequences; for example, we showthat agents can initially learn the true state but later forget it and believethe erroneous state to be true instead. In short, we argue that varying thelearning horizon can lead to dramatically different outcomes.

First, a rating provided on a set conveyssome preference information about each of the set&#39;s items, which allows us toacquire a user&#39;s preferences for more items that the number of ratings that theuser provided. Second, due to privacy concerns, users may not be willing toreveal their preferences on individual items explicitly but may be willing toprovide a single rating to a set of items, since it provides some level ofinformation hiding. This paper investigates two questions related to usingset-level ratings in recommender systems. First, how users&#39; item-level ratingsrelate to their set-level ratings. Second, how collaborative filtering-basedmodels for item-level rating prediction can take advantage of such set-levelratings. We have collected set-level ratings from active users of Movielens onsets of movies that they have rated in the past. Our analysis of these ratingsshows that though the majority of the users provide the average of the ratingson a set&#39;s constituent items as the rating on the set, there exists asignificant number of users that tend to consistently either under- orover-rate the sets. We have developed collaborative filtering-based methods toexplicitly model these user behaviors that can be used to recommend items tousers. Experiments on real data and on synthetic data that resembles the under-or over-rating behavior in the real data, demonstrate that these models canrecover the overall characteristics of the underlying data and predict theuser&#39;s ratings on individual items.", "subject": "cs"}, {"title": "Forward Vehicle Collision Warning Based on Quick Camera Calibration\"", "author": ["Lu, Yuwei\"", "Yuan, Yuan\"", "Wang, Qi\""], "date": "2019/04/22\"", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12642", "abstract": "Forward Vehicle Collision Warning (FCW) is one of the most importantfunctions for autonomous vehicles.

The redesigned style code embeds image style intotwo variables drawn from standard Gaussian distribution and the distribution ofdomain label, which facilitates the fine control of translation due to thecontinuity of both variables.

Since the problem of computing an optimal coloring, or evenapproximating it to within $n^{1-\u03b5}$ for any $\u03b5&gt; 0$, is NP-hardin static graphs, there is no hope to achieve any meaningful computationalresults for general graphs in the dynamic setting. It is therefore only naturalto consider the combinatorial aspects of dynamic coloring, or alternatively,study restricted families of graphs.  Towards understanding the combinatorial aspects of this problem, one mayassume a black-box access to a static algorithm for $C$-coloring any subgraphof the dynamic graph, and investigate the trade-off between the number ofcolors and the number of recolorings per update step. In WADS&#39;17, Barba et al.devised two complementary algorithms: For any $\u03b2&gt; 0$ the first(respectively, second) maintains an $O(C \u03b2n^{1/\u03b2})$ (resp., $O(C\u03b2)$)-coloring while recoloring $O(\u03b2)$ (resp., $O(\u03b2n^{1/\u03b2})$)vertices per update. Our contribution is two-fold:  - We devise a new algorithm for general graphs that improves significantlyupon the first trade-off in a wide range of parameters: For any $\u03b2&gt; 0$, weget a $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{C}\u03b2\\log^2 n)$-coloring with $O(\u03b2)$ recoloringsper update, where the $\\tilde{O}$ notation supresses polyloglog$(n)$ factors.In particular, for $\u03b2=O(1)$ we get constant recolorings with polylog$(n)$colors; this is an exponential improvement over the previous bound.  - For uniformly sparse graphs, we use low out-degree orientations tostrengthen the above result by bounding the update time of the algorithm ratherthan the number of recolorings.

In this paper, we reviewsome of the major promises and challenges of ML in wireless communicationsystems, focusing mainly on the physical layer. We present some of the moststriking recent accomplishments that ML techniques have achieved with respectto classical approaches, and point to promising research directions where ML islikely to make the biggest impact in the near future. We also highlight thecomplementary problem of designing physical layer techniques to enabledistributed ML at the wireless network edge, which further emphasizes the needto understand and connect ML with fundamental concepts in wirelesscommunications.", "subject": "cs"}, {"title": "Enhancing Prediction Models for One-Year Mortality in Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction and Post Myocardial Infarction Syndrome\"", "author": ["Payrovnaziri, Seyedeh Neelufar\"", "Barrett, Laura A.\"", "Bis, Daniel\"", "Bian, Jiang\"", "He, Zhe\""], "date": "2019/04/28\"", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12383", "abstract": "Predicting the risk of mortality for patients with acute myocardialinfarction (AMI) using electronic health records (EHRs) data can help identifyrisky patients who might need more tailored care.

Such algorithms have been shown to be useful inmultiplayer settings, e.g. to solve the wireless network selection problem,which can be formulated as an adversarial bandit problem. A leading banditalgorithm for the adversarial setting is EXP3. However, network behavior isoften repetitive, where user density and network behavior follow regularpatterns. Bandit algorithms, like EXP3, fail to provide good guarantees forperiodic behaviors. A major reason is that these algorithms compete againstfixed-action policies, which is ineffective in a periodic setting.  In this paper, we define a periodic bandit setting, and periodic regret as abetter performance measure for this type of setting. Instead of comparing analgorithm&#39;s performance to fixed-action policies, we aim to be competitive withpolicies that play arms under some set of possible periodic patterns $F$ (forexample, all possible periodic functions with periods $1,2,\\cdots,P$). Wepropose Periodic EXP4, a computationally efficient variant of the EXP4algorithm for periodic settings. With $K$ arms, $T$ time steps, and where eachperiodic pattern in $F$ is of length at most $P$, we show that the periodicregret obtained by Periodic EXP4 is at most $O\\big(\\sqrt{PKT \\log K + KT \\log|F|}\\big)$.

Ourgoal is to produce a reinforcement structure of minimal weight. It has beendemonstrated that optimal reinforcement structures may be qualitativelydifferent, depending on external loads and surface shape. In some cases, itnaturally consists of discrete protruding ribs; in other cases, a smooth shellthickness variation allows to save more material.  Most previously proposed solutions, starting from classical Michell trusses,are not able to handle a full range of shells (e.g., are restricted toself-supporting structures) or are unable to reproduce this range of behaviors,resulting in suboptimal structures.  We propose a new method that works for any input surface with any loadconfigurations, taking into account both in-plane (tensile/compression) andout-of-plane (bending) forces. By using a more precise volume model, we arecapable of producing optimized structures with the full range of qualitativebehaviors.

Surprisingly, the fundamental question ofwhether or not these dependencies on $\u03b5$ and $d$ for small $d$ can beimproved has remained elusive, even for $d = 2$.

The regularization improves theperformance of the model over the traditional stratified model, since the modelfor each value of the categorical `borrows strength&#39; from its neighbors. Inparticular, it produces a model even for categorical values that did not appearin the training data set.  We propose an efficient distributed method for fitting stratified models,based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). When thefitting loss functions are convex, the stratified model fitting problem isconvex, and our method computes the global minimizer of the loss plusregularization; in other cases it computes a local minimizer. The method isvery efficient, and naturally scales to large data sets or numbers ofstratified feature values. We illustrate our method with a variety of examples.", "subject": "cs"}, {"title": "3D-SIC: 3D Semantic Instance Completion for RGB-D Scans\"", "author": ["Hou, Ji\"", "Dai, Angela\"", "Nie\u00dfner, Matthias\""], "date": "2019/04/26\"", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12012", "abstract": "This paper focuses on the task of semantic instance completion: from anincomplete, RGB-D scan of a scene, we aim to detect the individual objectinstances comprising the scene and jointly infer their complete objectgeometry.

This leads to alarge number of required expensive evaluations of the mathematical model. Toovercome these challenges, we formulate and test a multilevel adaptive sparseLeja algorithm. At each level, adaptive sparse grid interpolation andquadrature are used to approximate the posterior and perform all quadratureoperations, respectively. Specifically, our algorithm uses coarsediscretizations of the underlying mathematical model to investigate theparameter space and to identify areas of high posterior probability. Adaptivesparse grid algorithms are then used to place points in these areas, and ignoreother areas of small posterior probability. The points are weighted Lejapoints. As the model discretization is coarse, the construction of the sparsegrid is computationally efficient. On this sparse grid, the posterior measurecan be approximated accurately with few expensive, fine model discretizations.The efficiency of the algorithm can be enhanced further by exploiting more thantwo discretization levels.

Thisframework minimizes spectral-amplitude distances for model training, which canbe efficiently implemented by using short-time Fourier transform routines.Under this framework, we designed three NSF models and compared them withWaveNet.

The proposed method cancomprehensively extract the range in which the input value leading to thefailure exists; therefore, by creating an input filter based on that range, itis possible to prevent the failure occurring in the system.

The first model is a distance toll thatis linearly related to the distance traveled within the cordon. The secondmodel is an improved joint distance and time toll (JDTT) whereby users arecharged jointly in proportion to the distance traveled and time spent withinthe cordon. The third model is a further improved joint distance and delay toll(JDDT) which replaces the time toll in the JDTT with a delay toll component. Tosolve the optimal toll level problem, we develop a simulation-basedoptimization (SBO) framework.

While the framework is developed for static pricing, we showthat it can be easily extended to solve time-dependent pricing by usingmultiple PI controllers. Results show that although the distance toll keeps thenetwork from entering the congested regime of the NFD, it naturally drivesusers into the shortest paths within the cordon resulting in an unevendistribution of congestion.

In this paper, a mathematicalframework is introduced for analyzing and mitigating the effects of GPSspoofing attacks on UAVs. In particular, system dynamics are used to model theoptimal routes that the UAVs will adopt to reach their destinations. The GPSspoofer&#39;s effect on each UAV&#39;s route is also captured by the model. To thisend, the spoofer&#39;s optimal imposed locations on the UAVs, are analyticallyderived; allowing the UAVs to predict their traveling routes under attack.Then, a countermeasure mechanism is developed to mitigate the effect of the GPSspoofing attack. The countermeasure is built on the premise of cooperativelocalization, in which a UAV can determine its location using nearby UAVsinstead of the possibly compromised GPS locations. To better utilize theproposed defense mechanism, a dynamic Stackelberg game is formulated to modelthe interactions between a GPS spoofer and a drone operator.

The time required for aMarkov chain to converge to its stationary distribution is known as theclassical mixing time. In this article, we deal with analog quantum algorithmsfor mixing. First, we provide an analog quantum algorithm that given a Markovchain, allows us to sample from its stationary distribution in a time thatscales as the sum of the square root of the classical mixing time and thesquare root of the classical hitting time. Our algorithm makes use of theframework of interpolated quantum walks and relies on Hamiltonian evolution inconjunction with von Neumann measurements. We also make novel inroads into adifferent notion for quantum mixing: the problem of sampling from the limitingdistribution of quantum walks, defined in a time-averaged sense. In thisscenario, the quantum mixing time is defined as the time required to samplefrom a distribution that is close to this limiting distribution. This notion ofquantum mixing has been explored for a handful of specific graphs and thederived upper bound for this quantity has been faster than its classicalcounterpart for some graphs while being slower for others. In this article,using several results in random matrix theory, we prove an upper bound on thequantum mixing time of Erd\u00f6s-Renyi random graphs: graphs of $n$ nodes whereeach edge exists with probability $p$ independently. For example for denserandom graphs, where $p$ is a constant, we show that the quantum mixing time is$\\mathcal{O}(n^{3/2 + o(1)})$.
